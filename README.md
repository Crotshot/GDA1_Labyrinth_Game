Repository for Semester Three Game Design Assignment One : Labyrinth Game : 
Created by Oisín Ivory, Cillín Ivory and Pádraig Crotty.

Necromancers have set their sights on the long abandoned Minotaurs labyrinth and 
ressurected the beast to help them in conquering the lands.

Face off against the undead Minotaur as a hired mercenary in this three player PvPvE
board game. Players must traverse through the Minotaur's labyrinth collecting powerful
gear and items from the necromancer's ressurected skeletons in order to help them defeat
the minotaur. Which player will take the Minotaur's head home and win the game, only time 
will tell.

The game is currently playabe in Tabletop Simulator on Steam when subscribed to
